  Ep. 160 - Ashlee Vance: Elon Musk and the Quest to Save Mankind
  </title>
 <description>
 He didn’t have permission.
 But he did it anyway. And one day Elon Musk called him.
 “He was either going to make life really horrible on me or he was going to cooperate with the book” said Ashlee Vance, author of the New York Times bestseller and Wall Street Journal’s “best books of the year,” Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.
 Ashlee did 200 interviews before Elon agreed, proving permission is not a starting place.
